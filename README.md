# Output
### Generative AI: 
• Generative AI refers to a class of artificial intelligence models that are capable of generating 
creative content, often in the form of text, images, or even audio.  
• These models are designed to produce novel output that is not directly copied from the input 
data.  
• Generative AI systems, like GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) and VAEs (Variational 
Autoencoders), work by learning patterns and generating content from scratch based on those 
patterns.  
• Some popular examples of Generative AI include: 
• Generative AI is a broad term that can be used for any AI system whose primary function is to 
generate content.  
• This is in contrast to AI systems that perform other functions, such as classifying data (e.g., 
assigning labels to images), grouping data (e.g., identifying customer segments with similar 
purchasing behavior), or choosing actions (e.g., steering an autonomous vehicle). 
• Typical examples of generative AI systems include image generators (such as Midjourney or 
Stable Diffusion), large language models (such as GPT-4, PaLM, or Claude), code generation 
tools (such as Copilot), or audio generation tools (such as VALL-E or resemble.ai).  
• (Disclosure: I serve in an uncompensated capacity on the non-profit board of directors for 
OpenAI, the company behind GPT-4.) 
• Using the term “generative AI” emphasizes the content-creating function of these systems. It 
is a relatively intuitive term that covers a range of types of AI that have progressed rapidly in 
recent years.
### GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks):  
GANs consist of two neural networks, a generator, and a discriminator, which work in opposition to 
produce realistic outputs. GANs have been used to create realistic images, deepfakes, and more. 
### VAEs (Variational Autoencoders):  
VAEs are used to generate data by learning the underlying structure and variability within a dataset. 
They have applications in image generation and text generation. 
### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):  
RNNs are used for sequence-to-sequence tasks, making them suitable for text generation, language 
translation, and more. Generative AI is a broad field with applications across various domains, 
including art, entertainment, content generation, and even scientific research. 
### Key characteristics of Generative AI:
### a. Creativity: 
Generative AI systems are designed to be creative and produce content that is not found in their 
training data. They can generate new ideas, artworks, or text that is unique and often 
unpredictable. 
### b. Variability: 
These models can produce a wide range of outputs, making them useful in creative tasks such as 
art, music, and storytelling. 
### c. Not language-focused:  
While Generative AI can work with text, it is not limited to language generation and can be used 
for various creative applications. 
## Large Language Models: 
• Large language models (LLMs) are a type of AI system that works with language.  
• In the same way that an aeronautical engineer might use software to model an airplane wing, 
a researcher creating an LLM aims to model language, i.e., to create a simplified—but useful—
 digital representation.  
• The “large” part of the term describes the trend towards training language models with more 
parameters. 
•  A key finding of the past several years of language model research has been that using more 
data and computational power to train models with more parameters consistently results in 
better performance.  
• Accordingly, cutting-edge language models trained today might have thousands or even 
millions of times as many parameters as language models trained ten years ago, hence the 
description “large.” 
• Typical examples of LLMs include OpenAI’s GPT-4, Google’s PaLM, and Meta’s LLaMA. There is 
some ambiguity about whether to refer to specific products (such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT or 
Google’s Bard) as LLMs themselves, or to say that they are powered by underlying LLMs.  
• As a term, LLM is the most specific of the three discussed here and is often used by AI 
practitioners to refer to systems that work with language.  
• Nonetheless, it is still a somewhat vague descriptor.  
• It is not entirely clear what should and shouldn’t count as a language model—does a model 
trained on programming code count? What about one that primarily works with language, but 
can also take images as inputs?  
• There is also no established consensus on what size of model should count as “large.” 
• Foundation model is a term popularized by an institute at Stanford University. It refers to AI 
systems with broad capabilities that can be adapted to a range of different, more specific 
purposes.  
• In other words, the original model provides a base (hence “foundation”) on which other 
things can be built.  
• This is in contrast to many other AI systems, which are specifically trained and then used for a 
particular purpose. 
• Typical examples of foundation models include many of the same systems listed as LLMs 
above. To illustrate what it means to build something more specific on top of a broader base, 
consider ChatGPT.  
• For the original ChatGPT, an LLM called GPT-3.5 served as the foundation model. Simplifying 
somewhat, OpenAI used some chat-specific data to create a tweaked version of GPT-3.5 that 
was specialized to perform well in a chatbot setting, then built that into ChatGPT.  
• At present, “foundation model” is often used roughly synonymously with “large language 
model” because language models are currently the clearest example of systems with broad 
capabilities that can be adapted for specific purposes.  
• The relevant distinction between the terms is that “large language models” specifically refers 
to language-focused systems, while “foundation model” is attempting to stake out a broader 
function-based concept, which could stretch to accommodate new types of systems in the 
future.  
• This post aims to clarify what each of these three terms mean, how they overlap, and how 
they differ.  
• It is important to note that at a technical level there are no bright lines that separate these 
terms from each other, or from other types of AI.  
• Each term is an attempt to gesture towards a cluster of systems of interest, not a watertight 
category.  
• There is also no clear hierarchy between the terms: for instance, generative AI could include 
LLMs or foundation models when these are used for generative use cases, but not when used 
in other ways. 
• Given how the AI landscape is evolving, the terms we use to describe these systems are sure 
to shift further in the future.  
• As is often the case with AI, anyone using these terms in a context where the precise 
definition matters should take care to delineate precisely what they intend—and don’t 
intend—the term to cover. 
• GPT-1 which was released in 2018 contains 117 million parameters having 985 million words. 
• GPT-2 which was released in 2019 contains 1.5 billion parameters. 
• GPT-3 which was released in 2020 contains 175 billion parameters. Chat GPT is also based on 
this model as well. 
• GPT-4 model is released in the early 2023 and it is likely to contain trillions of parameters. 
• GPT-4 Turbo was introduced in late 2023, optimized for speed and cost-efficiency, but its 
parameter count remains unspecified. 
### GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer):  
The GPT series, such as GPT-2 and GPT-3, are renowned for their text generation capabilities. They are 
often used for tasks like language translation, content generation, and chatbots. 
BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers):  
BERT models are designed for natural language understanding and perform exceptionally well on 
tasks like sentiment analysis, question-answering, and more. 
Large Language Models are versatile and can be fine-tuned for specific tasks, making them valuable 
tools in various applications, from chatbots and virtual assistants to content generation and text 
classification.

tasks, making them versatile and adaptable. 
### c. Not necessarily creative:  
While Large Language Models can generate text, their output is often limited to producing 
coherent and contextually relevant content. They are less focused on creative, novel generation 
compared to other Generative AI models. 
### Foundation Models: 
Foundation Models are at the forefront of AI research and technology. These models are designed to 
serve as the basis for a wide range of AI applications, including both language-related tasks and other 
domains. They are often large-scale models, like GPT-3 or its successors, and serve as the foundation 
upon which specialized models can be built. 
### Some examples of Foundation Models include: 
### OpenAI’s GPT-3:  
While GPT-3 is a Large Language Model, it can also be viewed as a Foundation Model because of its 
extensive knowledge base and versatility in various applications, beyond just text generation. 
### Google’s T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer):  
T5 is a model that frames all NLP tasks as a text-to-text problem, making it highly adaptable to a wide 
range of tasks. 
Foundation Models serve as a base upon which developers and researchers can build specialized AI 
applications. They provide a strong starting point for various domains, such as natural language 
processing, computer vision, and more. 
### Key characteristics of Foundation Models: 
### a. Versatility:  
Foundation Models are general-purpose and versatile, capable of being fine-tuned for specific 
applications. They can serve as the starting point for various AI tasks beyond language processing, 
such as image recognition and even medical diagnosis. 
### b. Scalability: 
These models are often extremely large, with millions or even billions of parameters, allowing 
them to capture vast amounts of knowledge and nuances. 
### c. Potential for creative tasks:  
While not their primary focus, Foundation Models can be used for creative tasks when fine-tuned 
and adapted, but their primary strength lies in their versatility and adaptability. 
### Conclusion 
In summary, Generative AI, Large Language Models, and Foundation Models are distinct categories of 
artificial intelligence models, each with its own set of characteristics and applications. Generative AI is 
known for its creativity and versatility in generating content, while Large Language Models, like GPT
3, excel in natural language processing tasks. Foundation Models serve as the cornerstone for a wide 
array of AI applications, providing a versatile starting point for specialized models. Understanding the 
differences between these categories is crucial for leveraging their capabilities effectively and 
choosing the right model for specific tasks in the evolving landscape of artificial intelligence.
